I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Institute for Foundations of Data Science (FDS)](https://fds.yale.edu/), Yale University.
I obtained my PhD degree in [Applied Mathematics and Computational Science](https://www.amcs.upenn.edu/) at University of Pennsylvania in 2023,  advised by [Prof. Paris Perdikaris](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h_zkt1oAAAAJ&hl=en).  Before that, I received my B.S. degree in [Mathematics](https://maths.whu.edu.cn/Englishversion/) at Wuhan University. My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, scientific computing, and computational physics.  I am particularly interested in developing scalable and robust algorithms for solving partial differential equations, and leveraging these algorithms to solve challenging problems in science and engineering.
